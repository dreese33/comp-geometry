# Computational Geometry Experimentation
This repository will be dedicated to learning computational geometry algorithms and their applications through low level graphics API's, such as OpenGL.

## To run:
Run the following command:
`source build.sh`
Note: this has primarily been tested on MacOS. Linux should be supported; however, it has not been tested extensively. Windows is not currently supported.
