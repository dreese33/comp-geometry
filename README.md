# Computational Geometry Experimentation
This repository will be dedicated to learning computational geometry algorithms and their applications through low level graphics API's, such as OpenGL. Additional programming topics/data structures/algorithms are implemented and explored via various graphics simulations as well.

## To run:
Run the following command:
`sh scripts/build.sh`
Note: this has primarily been tested on MacOS. Linux should be supported; however, it has not been tested extensively. Windows is not currently supported. This repo is WIP, future support for other operating systems will come with future iterations.

## Dependencies:
This project makes use of the following dependencies to run and load OpenGL:
1. GLAD
2. SDL2/SDL2_image - to install this, I highly recommend checking out this link: https://lazyfoo.net/SDL_tutorials/lesson01/index.php

On MacOS, you can easily install with homebrew via `brew install sdl2 sdl2_image`
